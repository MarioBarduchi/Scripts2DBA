# Scripts2DBA

Hello all

I've created repository and I'm going to start sharing some scripts that I like to make and that help me in my day-to-day life as a DBA.

But some considerations are important:
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> 0d45944 (.)
	1) Some scripts are a compilation of several other scripts I've created. 
>>>>>>> 406515c (Initial version.)
	
	1) Some scripts are a compilation of several other scripts I've created. 
 
	2) Some scripts are based on and adapted from existing scripts. Those that I found reference to the author I obviously identify in the script.
	
	3) So, if there's a script that you're the author of and I've adapted to my reality and it's not mentioned, please let me know and I'll be happy to reference it.
	
	4) Because they're my scripts, they have my logic and help me in my day-to-day work, it doesn't mean that they're the best or that they're always the most refined and concerned with good practices. They can help you, but that's all.
	
	5) Feel free to make changes, but please keep the reference to the authors.
	
	6) If you find any mistakes, please let me know.

I hope this helps you.

Regards
Mario Barduchi
